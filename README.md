# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively.  For larger inputs, the recursive calls consume too much stack space, leading to a crash.  The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this using iteration.
